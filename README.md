# Hangman
The user will have only 6 guesses left which keeps on decrementing on giving incorrect input. The scoring is calculated: number of word character * remaining guesses 
# NOTE: 
      If the user gives wrong input which comes under the vowel character, then the guesses will be decreased by 2.
